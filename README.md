# demo-rag-chat

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat demo using Google Gemini API, Netlify Functions, and a static frontend.

## Features

- Chat UI for asking questions about a sample topic.
- Retrieves relevant document snippets from a local JSON knowledge base (`documents.json`).
- Sends context-augmented prompts to the Gemini API via a Netlify serverless function.
- Displays AI-generated answers in the chat interface.
- Integrates reCAPTCHA v3 and simple honeypot mechanism for bot/spam protection.

## Project Structure

```sh
netlify/functions/chat.js # Netlify Function
.env # Environment variables
.env.sample # Sample environment variables
.gitignore # Files to ignore in git
documents.json # Sample knowledge base
favicon.ico # Website favicon
index.html # Main HTML page
instructions.md # Custom prompt instructions
main.js # Frontend logic
marked.min.js # MD file formatting
package-lock.json # Node lock file
package.json # Node dependencies
README.md # Project documentation
sitemap.xml # Website sitemap
style.css # Basic styling
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/realadammatthew/demo-rag-chat.git
   cd demo-rag-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up your Gemini API key and reCAPTCHA**

    Copy your Gemini API key and reCAPTCHA secret key into a .env file in the root directory:
    
    ```sh
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-recaptcha-secret-key-here
    RECAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
    ```

    Also, set your reCAPTCHA v3 site key in `index.html` (see the `<meta name="recaptcha-site-key">` and script tag).

4. **Run locally with Netlify CLI**

    Install Netlify CLI if you don't have it:

    ```sh
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```

5. **Start the local dev server**

    ```sh
    netlify dev
    ```

    The app will be available at http://localhost:8888.

## Usage

- Open the app in your browser.
- Type a question related to the sample data.
- The app will find a relevant snippet from documents.json and send it, along with your question, to the Gemini API.
- The AI's answer will appear in the chat.

## How it Works

- `main.js`: Loads custom prompt instructions and custom dataset, requests a reCAPTCHA v3 token, and sends a prompt to the backend.
- `netlify/functions/chat.js`: Receives the prompt, verifies the reCAPTCHA token, calls the Gemini API, and returns the AI's response.
- `documents.json`: Contains sample data for retrieval.
- `instructions.md`: Contains custom prompt instructions for the chatbot.
- `index.html` and `style.css`: Provide the chat UI.

## Anti-Spam Protection

This demo uses a hidden honeypot field and reCAPTCHA v3 for spam prevention. The honeypot field is visually hidden from users but may be filled by bots. If the honeypot is filled, the backend will silently reject the request as spam. reCAPTCHA v3 is used to further protect against automated abuse. No user interaction is required, and there are no CAPTCHAs or visible challenges.

## Test reCAPTCHA Keys

This demo uses public test keys for reCAPTCHA v3, which are safe for development and testing purposes:

- **Site Key:** `6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI`
- **Secret Key:** `6LeIxAcTAAAAAGG-vFI1TnRWxMZNFuojJ4WifJWe`

You can use these keys locally or in your own test deployments. For production, generate your own keys at [Google reCAPTCHA Admin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create).

## Customizing Bot Behavior

You can control the NovaEdge chatbot's behavior and guardrails by editing the `instructions.md` file in the project root. The contents of this file are automatically prepended to every prompt sent to the Gemini API.

**How it works:**
- Edit `instructions.md` to add, remove, or change instructions for the bot.
- The file supports Markdown, but only the bullet points (not headings or comments) are sent to the AI.
- Example guardrails include how to handle confidential questions, off-topic prompts, or how to represent NovaEdge.
- Changes take effect immediately on the next chat request‚Äîno server restart needed.

This makes it easy to experiment with different bot personalities, compliance guardrails, or company messaging.

## Deployment

- Deploy to Netlify by connecting your repository and setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_ENABLED` environment variables in the Netlify dashboard.

## Notes

- This is a demo and does not include authentication or advanced error handling.
- The Gemini API key should be kept secret; do not expose it in client-side code or public repos.
